							<div className ="home-desc">Codedrop helps fill this content gap. We work with many industry experts to devise the most up-to-date, relevant problems that'll help you guage where you are in your studying process. Questions like, "Am I up to par with Algorithms?", "How much more do I need to know about Closures?", and "What Javascript abstractions do I need to brush up on" can be easily answered by seeing how well you fare against the many problems and tests we've set up.

And all of your friends are at work, and nobody else you know can help. No need to fret. Codedrop's Pair Programming feature allows you to queue up in our Partners Lobby to find others who are ready and willing to work alongside you.
